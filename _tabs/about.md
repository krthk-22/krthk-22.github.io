This is Karthikeya. I am a third year Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. 

Currently figuring out what do in life, enjoying the exploration and the experiences. I am deeply interested in lot of things a few of them are Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science, Movies, Sports. Apart from these I love travelling to new places and meet new people and reading books.

I do watch a lot of series, Crime and Sport Documentaries (might sound boring but I love them). I am a huge fan of [Game of Thrones]({{ site.url }}/categories/game-of-thrones/), Money Heist and Drive to Survive.
