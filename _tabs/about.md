This is Karthikeya. A CSE Undegrad at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). Currently figuring out what do in life, enjoying the exploration and the journey. I am interested in lot of things a few of them are Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science, Movies, Sports. Apart from these I love travelling to new places and reading books.

I do binge watch a lot of series, Crime and Sport Documentaries (might sound boring but I love them). I am a huge fan of Game of Thrones, Money Heist and Drive to Survive.
