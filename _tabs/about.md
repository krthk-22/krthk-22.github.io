This is Karthikeya. I am a 4th year Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. 

Currently figuring out what do in life, enjoying the exploration and the experiences it throws at me. I have a bunch of (diverse) interests from travelling, reading books, sports (playing and watching), movies to Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science, Reinforcement Learning any interesting mathematical topics for that reason.

I do binge-watch a lot of series mostly Crime and Sport Documentaries (might sound boring but I love them). I am a huge fan of [Game of Thrones]({{ site.url }}/categories/game-of-thrones/), Money Heist. Recently, I started following [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) (got interested after watching Drive to Survive).

I try to express my views on the books I read (if you are interested, you can look here for [books]({{ site.url }}/categories/books)).

If you would like to meet me or have a discussion with me (on anything under the sky or beyond) I would be very interested, please check my availability in this [calendar]({{ site.url }}/calendar/) and feel free to connect.
