This is Karthikeya. I am a 4th year Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. 

Currently figuring out what do in life, enjoying the exploration and the experiences it throws at me. I have a bunch of (diverse) interests from travelling, reading books, sports (playing and watching), movies to Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science, Reinforcement Learning any interesting mathematical topics for that reason.

Currently, I am working with [Prof.Jayalal Sarma](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~jayalal/) on Hardness Condensation of various boolean complexity measures and I am working with [SENAI Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/senai-iitm/) on learning Representations for Natural Images on Hyperbolic Spaces.

I do binge-watch a lot of series mostly Crime and Sport Documentaries (might sound boring but I love them). I am a huge fan of [Game of Thrones]({{ site.url }}/categories/game-of-thrones/), Money Heist. Recently, I started following [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) (got interested after watching Drive to Survive).

I try to express my views, thoughts and takeaways from the [books]({{ site.url }}/categories/books) and [research papers]({{ site.url }}/categories/research) I read.

If you would like to meet me or have a discussion with me (on anything under the sky or beyond) I would be very interested, please check my availability in this [calendar]({{ site.url }}/calendar/) and feel free to connect.
