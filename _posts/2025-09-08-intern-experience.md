I interned at [Graviton Research Captial](https://www.gravitontrading.com) as a Quantitative Researcher. It was my first experience working in a corporate firm. It was overall a fun experience and it is the first time I got complete financial independence. I experienced the life where, I was having abundant amount of money in hand and surrounded by good people who brought in variety and enjoyment into my life. In short I enjoyed there and it was a pretty new experience.

## Technical Parts

I analysed how market trends change during highly volatile periods. The work was mostly around how people are responding to various news regarding the market announcements and how are the prices moving during these periods. It was a good experience of making different hypothesis of how people would react during these periods and then testing the hypothesis. Overall it was a decently good experience gaining some insights into the markets and how Quantitative Trading works in general. I have also understood what are the different methods used to generate signals and what the traders would be looking at to generate a good signal.

## Party Culture

We had around 4 parties over the span of 2 months. It was a new experience for me (never really been to any proper restro bar in my 3 years of college ‚òπÔ∏è), there was a good vibe among the people working there and it was fun watching around the funny things people say and do when they are high. I really enjoyed the parties over there (wish there were more though üòÖ).

Here are the places where we partied hard:
- Luka Downtown
- Druken Botanist
- KOCA
- The Wine Company

## Gurugram Experience

In one word **HOTTTTTTT** üò≠ it was soo hot that I couldn't even step out during the day time and even in the evening time. The dry winds, they just slap you on your face. The weather was something which I wouldn't appreciate ig. On the contrast when it rains, the cars becomes boats ü§£, the roads are flooded with rain water. I think the weather in Gurugram is just at the extremes and there is no in between.

## Friends

I got to meet wonderful people there who are technically smart and also sweet and fun-loving. They made me believe me that `not all studious people are nerds` (though a few ~~a lot~~ exist). I would like to thank all of them for making my 2 months very enjoyable and I cherish those memories forever.
