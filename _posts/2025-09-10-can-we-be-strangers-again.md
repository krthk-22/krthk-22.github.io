# Review

This is a book that a few college students might connect. In short the book is about a boy who fell in love and then experiences the mixed emotions and doubts about his relationship. During this he develops feelings for another girl who is the best friend of his girlfriend and how these emotions untangle between them and what are the different phases and emotions this boy experiences in the very busy and toxic life of an IIM forms the crux of the story. This could be a good book if you are looking for a light read otherwise there is not much perspective the book provide in my opinion. If you a person who just came out of your breakup or still couldn't get off the past, this book could tell you that `better accept the past and move on rather than trying to ignore it`. The book in some sense tells that there will be few people who come into our life not to stay forever but to teach us some lessons and leave and we should also learn those lessons and move on and not to stick on to them or even their memories.
