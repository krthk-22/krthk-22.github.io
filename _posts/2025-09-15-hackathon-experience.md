Disclaimer: This is a very late post, so the timeline may be a bit skewed.

I would like to share a wonderful (and rewarding ü§ë) experience I had as part of CS Odyssey Chapter-1, the first-ever hackathon conducted by CSA, IIT Madras in collaboration with CrossBow Labs. The problem statement was in the cybersecurity domain. At that time, I was mostly a theory explorer and ML enthusiast, so I wasn't sure if I could solve a core cybersecurity or systems problem. Fortunately (or perhaps luckily), we received a problem statement that was more about applied ML for cybersecurity. I got excited and started working on the problem.

> **Problem Statement:** Design an algorithm to identify anomalies in human behaviour (not necessarily fraud detection). The focus was on identifying, classifying, and testing users when their behaviour deviates from their regular patterns.

This was my first time seriously participating in a hackathon, so my teammates and I brainstormed on the problem statement. Each of us proposed different methods to model and solve the problem. The entire process was exhausting but memorable, as it made us think about handling real-life problems, and the discussions felt meaningful‚Äîunlike random assignment or exam paper discussions. We could all see the potential consequences of our solutions.

Once we came up with a primary solution, we entered the phase of finding flaws and ways to improve it. Trust me, this was one of the hardest parts of the challenge. Having a primary solution kills half your motivation; you're tired, your body is pleading for rest, and your brain is overheated and can't process anything. Then, randomly, an idea hits at 4 a.m. You start using it, draw random flowcharts on the board, and iterate.

In the midst of all this, you feel satisfied and happy, so you start randomly playing, shouting, and singing even more random things. Then comes the time for the presentation (the most boring part), where you need to gather all your random thoughts, justify your decisions, and prepare for questions about what happens otherwise. The bigger problem is that you can't present well when sleep-deprived, and the words coming out are harder to understand than the solution itself.

Overall, I enjoyed this experience a lot and look forward to participating in more such interesting (and hopefully less exhausting) problems. Finally, we came first in the hackathon (otherwise, I wouldn't be talking about this lol üòù), which was a happy ending to the story. `The King claims the throne`. (I'm calling myself a king, but that's fine, I guess üòÖ).
