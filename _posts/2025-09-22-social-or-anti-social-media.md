## Social Media? or Anti-Social Media?

One of those thoughts that come to me very often (maybe not for most of you). I remember being a very fond user of Facebook, later followed by Instagram (not anymore tho). During that phase, I watched a lot of reels and short videos, memes, and other things. I remember sharing the so-called "interesting or funny stuff" with my friends (and harming them with the illusion of connectivity, which I realised much later) and bullying a few people at the beginning of college for not knowing what Instagram is (which I regret now). Recently (about 10 months as of this post), I realised these apps should not be used frequently if you want to socialise or keep in touch with friends (really). That is when I realised that these social media apps or websites spoiled the formation of deep connections and talks among people.

When I questioned how much time I spend with people without using these apps, I observed a few things. Whenever our friends go out for a dinner, a party or any event, there are significantly fewer (or none) conversations. Instead, people are sharing content online while sitting next to each other. By Conversations, I mean deep and meaningful conversations, not a surface-level or time-passing discussion on some memes we saw that day or then and there. Then I realised we know significantly little about each other and not much about our internal thoughts or philosophies of life. For a few days after that realisation, whenever we went outside, I tried asking them not to use these apps and have good conversations, and everyone went silent most of the time. Later, my friends started saying that you might not be interested in these, but this is my interest, so why are you asking me not to use it? I never had the answer except the craving for more profound and meaningful conversations. At that point, I started questioning `Whether all of these so-called social media apps are really helping you socialise, or are they making you anti-social in the name of socialising through social media?`

Here are my questions to people who say they use social media to keep their connections intact:
- When was the last time you had a meaningful conversation with your friend or friends, with whom you share content on social media every day?
- What time do you spend conversing on these apps besides watching and sharing random content?
- How often have you appreciated some rando for having and making good memories? But, how many times have you taken the effort to make good memories?
- What fraction of time are you spending looking into the eyes of the person standing before you, compared to your mobile?
- Do you know any real or meaningful reason to use those apps? - Don't say entertainment or enjoyment when you don't even know how to spend time with people around you, and don't even realise why people who want to spend time initially, became silent and started appreciating solitude rather than sitting in front of you just to feel less valued than your fucking mobile.
- Finally, can't you live without these apps? Will you die if you stop using them and start talking to people?

After asking myself about these, I realised that social media is evil and anti-social. I stopped using it, but unfortunately, not many around us (probably whoever is reading this) get what I am talking about and support their use of these apps. Fortunately, I realised it is brainless of me to try to convince these people; instead, finding people who also realised the same and looking for deep conversations is easier. If you are one such person, feel free to [catch-up](https://app.cal.com/karthikeya-p), and I would be more than happy to have a deep convo rather than sharing some shallow and irrelevant content.
