## What is that one thing?

This question repeatedly comes to me (I guess it has come to most of you at some point): `What is that one thing` that can keep me happy forever, even without having anything else? Does such a thing even exist for anyone? If so, is that the purpose of their life? I suppose most of us have thought about it, justified ourselves that there is no such thing, and moved on to do whatever we are doing, just because it is an easy choice to make in this anxious era, where we always try to do what most people are doing or appreciating.

I have always wondered how most people in society may seem to have a standard metric to judge how well a person is doing. Is it because people are not ready to come up with their own thoughts, or don't know what they could appreciate? So they chose just to accept something that already exists, like marks for school students, CGPA and/or number of internships and/or number of clubs for college students, money and position for working professionals (ironically, most people can't even understand the work other are doing but still judge)?

Leaving aside what others are thinking, I am trying to understand the one thing that keeps me happy forever. I sometimes wonder what happened to our daring behaviour as kidsâ€”we used to do whatever we felt like doing without thinking about the consequences. Slowly and unknowingly, a transition occurs to someone who is no longer you, trying to justify and please others and doing things that others would appreciate, without thinking about why we are even doing those things. We try to get good marks or ranks, which eventually leads to sound money, as if nothing else matters. If someone is going to appreciate (in most cases, through money) what we are doing, we tend to do that without thinking whether we actually like it or if it is our life's purpose and do we really want it. Sometimes, I feel most of us are just glorified prostitutes selling ourselves for money (and who among us is a better one), even though we genuinely can't make love with what we are doing. I agree that is money is important for surviving in this world, but is it the only thing and above everything else? Is it worth giving ourself away for that? Instead can't we get sufficient (or even sound) money by doing `that one thing`.

I want to return to the person I was as a child and do what I like. My interests have taken shape with the course of life, so what I do might not be completely random. At least, I would like to do what I would have done as a child with these interests and not run behind the appreciation from people. Instead, I want to find `that one thing` that can keep me happy for the rest of my life and pursue that.
