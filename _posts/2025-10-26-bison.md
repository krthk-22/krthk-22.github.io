# Review

I recently watched Bison by Mari Selvaraj which is an absolute masterpiece. This is one of those movies which I would go and watch again in the theatres. The movie at its core captures the following aspects and many more:
- Caste System
- Sport
- Passion

The director beautifully captured how the differences exist in our society based on the caste and the false accusations and doubts that it can bring on innocent people and societal judgements that are passed based on these biased opinions. He also captured how sport (or passion in anything for that matter) can take a man from the under-represented (or prolly under-valued) areas society to such a height so that everyone who once talked about all these biases starts calling him their man. Director also beautifully projected the feeling of an innocent person struggling to understand these biases present in the society where the only thing he is trying is to do is to pursue his passion which is playing kabaddi.

Also Dhruv Vikram's as an actor performed very well and all the other departments of the movie have gave their best especially the music.

## Favorite Scenes/Observations

### Father's Fear turned Answer
> At the start of the movie Kittan's Father would never allow (or encourages) him to play kabaddi as he was scared of the consequences. He was worried that his son would take part in the local gangwars once he joins kabaddi. Towards the end it is the game that helps Kittan break all the barriers and reach the heights.

### Two Good People with Enimity
> Both Pandiaraja and Kandasamy are good at their heart one who wants to eliminate the caste biases and the other who values talent over anything. Both these people turned out to be helpful in Kittan's Journey through Kabaddi and Life. One gave him a headstart in Kabaddi and other by helping to keep his love. This shows two good people could be enemies and we never know who could turn helpful in ones life.

There were many more metaphors which I would like to talk about and also a lot of complex emotions which I can't describe in words which are to be experienced. This is one of those movies which I would suggest everyone to watch.
