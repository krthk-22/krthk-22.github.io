# Review

First things first, I am very happy to read this book. I am proud to say that the author is one of my closest friends and we have grown together from our class 5 to class 12, made a lot of good memories and still continuing to do that. Seeing him start a blog and eventually write this book (his first book btw) made me really happy and I wish from the bottom of my heart that he become a great writer in the future (so that I can meet big big people like him üòÖ). There is a lot more to talk about us, which might need a series of posts to share the moments we experienced.So, I will restrict myself to the book in this post (after the two pics I want to share ü•π).

When I started reading this book since I know the author personally and that it is his debut book. I expected to see a lot of references from his personal life but I am truly surprised, by the way the story unfolded without any (or very few) experiences from the author's life, this made me wonder and salute for his imagination of such a story line. I started reading the book and by the end of fourth chapter I really got hooked to its storyline and was truly curious to know how the story would unfold. I kept reading and my man didn't disappoint me at any point of the book. The book is a nice fictional story which captures the after life of a marriage and/or long-term relationship. There are a lot of parts of the book which I liked a lot and also a few parts where I felt could be improved but this is truly a masterpiece considering this is the first time he wrote a book.

The following are the key elements which I liked in the book:
- Multi-perspective Narration (we don't find many books doing that)
- Deep Connections among the characters
- Small yet interesting twists
- Lot of Mixed and intense emotions

Some minor drawbacks which I felt in the book were:
- Could have added cliffhangers in the first 2 chapters
- Could have hidden the main twist a bit longer
- Multi-perspective sligthly brought in some repitition

Overall it was a goodread and looking forward to read his upcoming books (starting with `Innocent Devotee` in April 2026). This work made me realise how most of us skip the works of debut authors just because the author is not famous or we never heard of him but there could be good works from debut authors as well. Hmm, time to change my perspective and become more explorative.

All the best man for all your future works. Have a blast üí•.

## Final Thoughts

- Who should read this book?
> I would suggest everyone to read this. Best suited for grown-ups with enough life experiences to appreciate the emotions depicted in the story and relate to the emotions that life threw at you.
- What‚Äôs the biggest takeaway?
> Debut authors can also present really good work.
- Would you reread/recommend it?
> I will definitely recommend reading it. I might probably read this again (might not be in near future tho.)
