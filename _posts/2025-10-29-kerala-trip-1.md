I have been to Kerala recently (26th Sep - 1st Oct) with a lot of academic commitments lined up immediately once I come back. I needed that break very badly to regain my calm during the overwhelming semester. Ironically, the start of this was even more stressful than the semester lol. I would like to put it out somewhere hence I chose to put it here.

## The Decision
My sister invited me for this 5-day trip, I was looking forward to travel somewhere as it has been a long time (about 1 month) since I went on some trip. But then the timeline which she proposed was very tight for me with exams and a couple of deadlines coming up the week before I leave and just after I come back (few existed during the week as well, but lite). So, I gave it a lot of thought ~~for preparing some excuses for a few courses~~ and then decided 2-3 days before the start to join her.

Then begins the hunt for tickets to Kerala from Chennai as everyone else in that trip were coming from Hyderabad. Fortunately, I found one of the buses which would take me to Ernakulam by 27th morning and scheduled at 7:30PM in Chennai on 26th. Since I had no choice left I decided to book that (which I regret doing now tho ðŸ˜…).

## The Plan
This is something which is not advisable to do (but I tend to do everytime I travel). That is, I expect everything to be happening ideally. For Example say I need to catch the bus at 7:30PM which is 20km away from my destination then my calculation would go like this.. 20km with an average speed of 30kmph would take 40mins and say worst case it took 20mins to book a cab, it would at max take 1hr to catch the bus. So the latest I could start by is 6:30PM and so I decided to do that.

So I planned an academic meeting from 5PM-6PM on 26th and decided to leave once it is done. Thinking such a great plan I made and the schedule was perfect with no wastage of time.

## The Execution
According to my plan everything was fine (except that it was not in practice ðŸ¥²) that I ended the meeting at sharp 6PM and started immediately. Unfortunately (maybe obviously) there was a lot of traffic (which I didn't take into account for my calculations) I got stuck and realised that I couldn't catch the bus on time. Naturally, I called the bus operator and asked him is the bus running late and luckily (which I realised was not the case later) he said it is. Then I felt a bit relaxed and got down at the nearest stop which the bus would arrive before the time mentioned by the operator which was 8:30PM (though it was having a delay of 1hr). 

## The Failure (not mine but mine)
While waiting for the bus, I decided to have dinner and then wait in the restaurant. I finished my dinner by around 8:15PM and then called the bus driver to confirm the delay and the current status of the bus. The operator didn't pick up the call ðŸ˜Ÿ I got worried and then tried calling him again at 8:30PM and this process continued till 9:15PM when he picked up and said that the bus broke down ðŸ˜‘. Then I asked how long would it take (notice that I am already running late by 2hours) which he said he is not certain of. Then I decided to wait and then called them again at 10:00PM then he says that the bus would be coming in 10min and asks to confirm once again with the driver. I call the driver and he says that he already crossed the stop which I was waiting at.. I mean that is ridiculous.. I was waiting for 2hrs and yet missed the bus not my fault tho. Then I asked him to wait at the next stop he could so that I can join.

## The Chase
Then I found some other bus which was going towards the same direction and requested the driver to help me catch the bus. Then I got in and started chasing my original bus. See how lucky I was now, right? Turns out that every single passenger who are supposed to board in this bus are 10min late ðŸ˜­ so the driver of this bus was waiting for them (fair enough, except that my bus driver didn't care). Then these people picked up their passengers by this time my bus has left the picture completely. Now I don't know what to do, except that the Chase was useless.

## The Finale
Again fortunately (this time really), the bus I boarded to chase my original bus was also going to the same destination (Ernakulam). Then I thought okay if there is any berth empty in this bus I will request the driver and go there (obviously money involved). There was exactly one seat which was empty (as one more poor fellow like me, missed this bus) which I was assigned. Then I thought, since there was a 3hrs delay compared to what was planned I would reach the destination 3hours which can be accomodated and slept in peace.

I woke up in the morning and realised that the bus was running some 6hrs late compared to what I was expecting ðŸ™‚ at this point I can't get down and can't do anything about the situation except to accept the fact that I am gonna miss the first day of my trip. I was in contact with my sister and she was updating me where they were going so that I could catch them and then join the trip.

I got down at Angamaly and started towards Adimali as said by two interesting people I met in the bus. So I got down and took local bus and started chasing the tempo in which my sister was travelling. Which I managed to do at around 5:30 at a Zipline at the right time (after one more local bus breakdown in between).

## The Grand Finale (lol)
Finally, After finishing the Zipline we went to our stay and I was about to relax peacefully thinking that everything that has to happen has already happened now I can enjoy the trip peacefully. Then comes our guide (whom I invited to play UNO) who sits on the glass table available in the room. Then I hear a sound and find the guide on groud with a glass piece cut through his pant. Then comes the phase where went to the hospital and got to know that he has a deep cut and need to take a month long rest.

This particular incident concludes as the Grand Finale of the many interesting (prolly crazy) things that happened in the process of me reaching to Kerala before I actually stared my trip lol. This was a crazy experience at first hand for me which I feel is good enough once but not again.
