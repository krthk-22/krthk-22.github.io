# Review

I don't understand whether people are reading this book just because they started or do they really like it? I am also surprised by its rating. Do people really like this kind of stuff? Personally I didn't enjoy the book but finished just because I started it. The book felt to be a fictional version of toxic-feminism which just uses domestic violence so that no one can claim the other side to be correct (by this I am not supporting domestic violence but only felt that it was being used to build a wrong perspective). I felt the views of the book to be manipulative which are very flawed in their own way. 

The author talks as if Lily can do whatever she want to do and can hurt Ryle (or anyone for that matter) mentally but that doesn't carry any value. Only thing which matters to our author is whether he raised hand against her or not? Maybe hitting her is wrong but she deserves to be punished in some way or the other (not physically) but I donno how. The author masks the pain of Ryle using domestic violence as a tool for distraction. The idealogy is so skewed and these kind of authors should not be encouraged, if we would like to see at least some meaningful relationships in the society in future.

## Final Thoughts

- Who should read this book?
> Noone, unless they are toxic feminists and want to support their claims without any reasoning or logic. The book serves absolutely no purpose instead it ruins your mood or change your idealogy into something that is not good for society.
- What’s the biggest takeaway?
> Not to read Colleen Hoover's books again. This book made me realise very bad authors do exist, somehow a few of them become famous and can influence (brainwash tbh) a bunch of brainless folks and make them believe in the wrong ideology.
- Would you reread/recommend it?
> I won't read it again and wouldn't recommend it anyone if they want to live in a good manner, if you are looking for how bad a person's perspectives can be or skewed views can be you can read this book (disclaimer: you'll regret your read and wasting time on this book).
