Tyrion, this man is an absolute classic. This is the first time I found myself loving a character to this extent. He is the most intelligent, witty and funny character of the series. Whenever he appears on the screen there is a kinda of energy that comes with him. [His trial](#tyrions-courtroon-speech) is one of my most favourite scenes of the series. The way he outsmarts everyone is just amazing. The first time I saw this man I thought he is just going to be a side character and doesn't have much to do in the series but the way he is written and his character develops truly amazed me. He is the most loved character of the series and I am no exception.

His witty one-liners are just amazing. His dialogues are so well written and the way he delivers them is just perfect. He is a bold man who doesn't fear anyone and always speaks his mind. Apart from these his love towards his family is something that I admire the most. He truly loves them despite the way they treat him and always wants to protect them. The relationship between Lannister brothers is very well written and the way they back the other regardless of the consequences that it brings is very touching.

## Tyrion's Courtroom Speech
The trial of Tyrion is my most favourite scene of the entire series. When he is falsely accused of killing Joffrey and he is put on trial, there are lot of emotions going on. It just reflects how one will feel when everyone is intentionally trying to put you down for something that you have not done. He was able to take all the accusations, insults and false witness against him from everyone except from Shae (his lover). When she provides the false witness against him, he just breaks down and delivers the most powerful and emotional speech of the series. The way he says "I wish I was the monster you think I am" is just heart-wrenching. This scene is a perfect example of how great actor Peter Dinklage is and how well the character Tyrion is written.

"I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had! Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores! I wish I was the monster you think I am! I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you! I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it!" - Tyrion
