Tyrion Lannister is an absolute classic—never before have I found myself so invested in a character. His intelligence, wit, and humor make every scene he’s in come alive with a unique energy. [His trial](#tyrions-courtroom-speech) stands out as one of the most powerful moments in the series, showcasing his ability to outsmart those around him even in the direst circumstances. Initially, I assumed he would be a minor character, but his depth and development quickly proved otherwise. Tyrion’s journey is a testament to brilliant writing and character growth, making him the most beloved figure in the series—and I’m certainly among his admirers.

His sharp one-liners and memorable dialogues are delivered with perfect timing, adding both levity and insight. Tyrion’s boldness and willingness to speak his mind, regardless of the consequences, set him apart. What I admire most, though, is his unwavering love for his family. Despite their treatment of him, he remains loyal and protective, especially towards his siblings. The bond between the Lannister brothers is beautifully portrayed, highlighting their support for each other even when the odds are stacked against them.

## Tyrion's Courtroom Speech
The trial of Tyrion is my most favourite scene of the entire series. When he was falsely accused of killing Joffrey and put on trial, there are lot of emotions going on. It just reflects how one will feel when everyone is intentionally trying to put you down for something that you have not done. He was able to take all the accusations, insults and false witness against him from everyone except from Shae (his girlfriend). When she provides the false witness against him, he just breaks down and delivers the most powerful and emotional speech of the series. The way he says "I wish I was the monster you think I am" is just heart-wrenching. This scene is a perfect example of how great actor Peter Dinklage is and how well the character Tyrion is written.

"I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had! Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores! I wish I was the monster you think I am! I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you! I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it!" - Tyrion

This was one of the iconic sentences delivered and the beauty of the sentence lies in capturing everyone involved starting from the `bastard` $\rightarrow$ `Joffery` highlighting that he was the son of `Jaime and Cersei`. `Whores` $\rightarrow$ `Shae` who used to be a whore. The way the dialogue captured all the internal rush of emotions from his past is just amazing.
