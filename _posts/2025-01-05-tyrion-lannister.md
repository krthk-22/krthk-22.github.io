Tyrion, this man is an absolute classic. This is the first time I found myself loving a character to this extent. He is the most intelligent, witty and funny character of the series. Whenever he appears on the screen there is a kinda of energy that comes with him. His trial is one of my most favourite scenes of the series. The way he outsmarts everyone is just amazing. The first time I saw this man I thought he is just going to be a side character and doesn't have much to do in the series but the way he is written and his character develops truly amazed me. He is the most loved character of the series and I am no exception.

## My Favourite Scene
The trial of Tyrion is my most favourite scene.
