# Review

The book is a good read where the author talks about the visits to his old professor suffering with ALS during his last days. The book goes in a conversational tone where the old Professor Morrie, talks about the various (important) aspects of life (from his perspective). I agree with few parts said by Morrie where as I couldn't connect or agree with a lot of them (maybe I am (currently) not in the same situation of Morrie).

Morrie talks about the love and compassion everyone should have towards others and says that it is the most important thing of ones life. He also talks about how the current generations are missing on various aspects of life and they are not living to their fullest which I agree with. Currently we are chasing a lot of materialistic things, leaving behind the purpose of life (perhaps not even thinking of it). I personally liked one aspect of life which morrie says
> When people say I want to go back to some age, that means most of the times they haven't experienced the life to the fullest at that point of time. They wish they could experience life to the fullest extent if they are given one more chance. But unfortunately we don't have that privilege.

This particular perspective motivated me to experience every moment of my life to the fullest. But overall the book felt repititive for most of the parts and keeps revolving around the same theme. If you are looking for a feel good (not completely though, the situation of Morrie is sad) or want to see the life perspective from a loving soul during his last days then this a good choice.

## Final Thoughts

- Who should read this book?
> Honestly, depends on what you are looking at. If you want to hear some soothing words or love-filled read then this is a good choice. Otherwise, you might just have a neural opinion on the book. Definitely, not a bad read.
- What’s the biggest takeaway?
> Experience every moment to the fullest, show love and compassion towards others (but I am not sure what exactly Morrie meant, so I decided to show in my way).
- Would you reread/recommend it?
> I probably won't reread the book. I would slightly recommend reading this book (not a very strong recommendation though).
