***"You know nothing Jon Snow!"***, this line which Ygritte says appears so true. Jon Snow is such a pure-hearted man who knows nothing about the cunning and ill thoughts of people surrounding him and infact he doesn't know that he is not a bastard. He always does what is correct even when he know that it is going to be hard and there is none (or just a few) to support him. The decisions he took are truly inspirational and all his decisions come from the idea of greater good rather than his personal interest. His bold decisions of uniting the Night's Watch and the Wildlings, fighting against the White Walkers, taking back Winterfell from Ramsay Bolton, killing Daenerys Targaryen are some of the examples of his leadership qualities. He is never interested in the Iron Throne and even after knowing that he is 'Aegon Targaryen' he didn't want to claim for it for his love. He is a true leader, great lover and a rational thinker and I wish to be like him in my life.

## Jon Snow's Leadership
Jon never fails to inspire us with his leadership qualities. He always stand in the front and take the first step in any situation. He is the one who believes in the power of unity and always tries to unite people for a common cause, despite the blame and revolt that it brings on him. His journey from being a bastard to the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and then the King in the North is truly inspiring.

Here are a few situations where his decisions are inspirational:
### Negotiation with the Wildlings
He is the first Lord Commander who understood the threat of the White Walkers and tried to unite the Night's Watch and the Wildlings to fight against them. He was the one who understood that the real enemy is not the Wildlings but the White Walkers and he took the bold decision to unite them. This decision was not accepted by many of his brothers and he was killed for this. But he never regretted his decision and he was brought back to life to continue his fight.

### Battle of the Bastards
This is one of the most epic battles in the series where Jon Snow fought against Ramsay Bolton to take back Winterfell. He was outnumbered and the situation was not in his favor. But he never gave up and fought till the end. He was saved by the Knights of the Vale at the last moment and he won the battle. This battle shows his courage and determination to fight for what is right and love towards Sansa Stark.

### Killing Danerys Targaryen
He loved Daenerys Targaryen and he believed in her vision of breaking the wheel. But when he realized that she is not the one he thought she is and she is going to be a tyrant, he took the bold decision to sacrifice his love for the greater good. He killed her to save the people of Westeros from her tyranny. This decision was not easy for him but he did it because he believed that it is the right thing to do.
