***"You know nothing Jon Snow!"***, this line which Ygritte says appears so true. Jon Snow is such a pure-hearted man who knows nothing about the cunning and ill thoughts of people surrounding him. He always does what is correct even when he know that it is going to be hard and there is none (or just a few) to support him. The decisions he took are truly inspirational and all his decisions come after a lot of thinking and understanding of the situation without having any personal interest. He is a true leader and a rational thinker and I wish to be like him in my life.
