# Review

To describe the book in one single sentence `A Beautiful Roller Coaster of Realistic Experiences`. I went to Phoenix Mall, Chennai along with my friend and we were roaming and I wanted to restart my book-reading habit and I was looking for a nice book to start with then I found this gem of a book in the Crossword top 30 fiction and I know that Sudha Murthy is a very good author (heard but never had first hand experience, I regret for not having that till now 😔). So I took this book and started reading on the same day itself. It was a simple (and more than that realistic) beautiful story of 5 friends with very diverse backgrounds coming together and experiencing the hidden surprises life gives.

The characters are very well written highlighting:
- How can a person change completely or how can life/experiences bring in 180° shift in a persons character?
- How broadly can the definitions of success span? Ranging from good family, knowledge to power, recognition and money. 
- How real is the saying "The Grass is always greener on the other side of the Court".

The book gave me a new way of looking at life and how to appreciate and embrace the experiences life throws at us. The book nicely describes what a single strong belief can do to different people (irrespective whether your belief is good or bad). The book shaped my perspective of seeing life and motivated me to explore many more things along the course, appreciating what I have. One of the best parts is that the book never uses very complicated language, which is a very good start for beginners. I would recommend everyone to read this book at least once in their life. The book is simply a soothing from the daily chaos of the modern life and makes you feel good and satisfied and cultivates a homely and positive feeling.
