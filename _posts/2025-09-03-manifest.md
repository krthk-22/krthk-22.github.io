# Review

The book was well written but I felt it to be a bit slower. The book details a good approach to build self-esteem and not to limit yourself to run towards what you truly want(your real goals). Since I read this book after [The Alchemist]({{ site.url }}/posts/alchemist) I felt this is how Santiago approached his life or this book captures the process through which he was able to acheive his dream of finding the treasure. I personally felt that Manifest is the secret guide for the alchemist to follow his heart.

## Outline

### 1. Be Clear in Your Vision
In this chapter the author describes how and why we should be clear in our vision. Being clear in your vision is essentially describing `what you really want to do in a more precise way` so that you have something to look upto, instead of just having random speculations or various perceptions like `may be this is what I want to do..`. Being clear in your vision eliminates the randomness/uncertainty that comes in.

### 2. Remove Fear and Doubt
In this chapter the author describes how to really identify `what we really want?` rather than `what we can get?` (practically, at least this is how the society calls it). The main philosophy being, there will be many instances in everyone's life where they would want something but they won't dare to say it out loud, as they are in a situation of self-doubt of whether they can acheive it or not? 

The author talks about `limiting beliefs and how to eliminate them`. The main take away for me was `We should never stop dreaming big saying that our eye is small`. So, really talk to yourself and ask what you really want without any involving other factors like ~~`whether I can get it?`~~, ~~`Is that really possible for me?`~~. Then you will find what you really want. Even before reading this, personally I never believed in the word `practical`: in my opinion this word is just used to hide your inability by simply saying that it is not possible.

### 3. Align Your Behaviour
In this chapter the author talks about the implementation of manifestation as a process and gives clarity on the myth that, if we believe that something will happen then it will happen on its own. That is not the case. Manifestation is the process where you try to align your actions towards your vision which when done consistently and patiently will bring in fruitful rewards and help you acheive your goals/vision which you invested in.

### 4. Overcome Tests from the Universe
This is a very important chapter in my opinion and very relatable for everyone (at least most of us). If we look back at life there will be many instances where we have made a decision just based on a safe choice rather than what we truly want. There will definitely be instances where we settled for less than what we really think we deserve. The author explains this as a distinction between two schools of thought `The Abundance Thought` which says that the universe has enormous amount of success which can be taken by everyone to their fullest whereas `The Deficiency Thought` which says that there is only a few amount of success so better grab it early or we might lose this opportunity. Unfortunately, most of us fall into the second category and often settle with/accept less than what we deserve.

I decided to make my choices from this moment solely based on whether I really want it or am I aiming for/deserve something better. From this day I am not going to settle for something less than I deserve.

### 5. Embrace Gratitude (without caveats)
This chapter also addresses a very serious concern which steals our happiness in most cases. There are things which should be grateful for (without any caveats) but most of us will attach something or the other to the gratitude which makes us feel incompleteness and this often leads to under appreciation of what we have and what we got. This doesn't mean/contradict the thought of going for what you deserve but in the process of going for what you deserve you should appreciate the milestones that you gather. This gratitude will help you to maintain a positive attitude and you will be able to see and appreciate the rewards the universe is giving for what your work and what deserve along the way to your ultimate vision.

### 6. Turn Envy into Inspiration
This chapter reframes envy as a signal for what you truly desire, rather than something negative. Instead of feeling resentful when you see others succeed, use that feeling as inspiration and motivation to pursue your own goals. The author suggests reflecting on why you feel envious and letting it guide you to clarify your own ambitions, turning comparison into a tool for growth rather than self-doubt.

---

### 7. Trust in the Universe
Trust in the universe is something that everyone should have is what I believe. This trust could be any form some people call it god, some people call it nature, some call it themselves, some call it subconscious mind whatever the names may be I believe that when you truly dedicate yourself in aliging what you want then the universe rewards you with what you truly deserve. The trust in the universe helps you to see the good things that are happening to you and you can feel the way you are reaching towards your vision.

Believe in the Universe and it rewards you in ways that you don't even expect.

## Final Thoughts

- Who should read this book?
> In my opinion, this book could be summarized in short but if you want to truly understand or read what the author wants to say in her own words then you should go and read. Otherwise you can get the crux of the ideas and try to implement them in your everyday life.
- What’s the biggest takeaway?
> `Don't settle for less than what you deserve. Universe has abundance amount of success so you can get what you want.`
- Would you reread/recommend it?
> I might reread selected portions of the book, I would recommend getting short summary of the book rather than reading the entire book itself.
