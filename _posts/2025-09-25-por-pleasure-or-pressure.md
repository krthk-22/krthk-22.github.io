Everyone (or at least most) enter college with a lot of expectations of making a lot of friends, creating a lot of good memories (eventually some bad also get created but that is fine), creating a good friend circle, having a lot of random chats, finding people with similar hobbies, creating something great that would change the world, getting a good paying job, finding a girlfriend (or a boyfriend), exploring many hobbies that one wanted to pursue before college and whatnot except going to classes and studying. There is a lot of enthusiasm radiating from everyone.

In the first week/month of the college we will be in the process of exploring what all things the college (excluding the professors) is offering to us. In this process we will get to know about lot of things called as clubs/societies/teams/interest groups and the list goes on. This is the time where (senior) engineers become sales executives and start pitching about these clubs or societies, trying to capture attention among the freshers and motivating them to apply for the club (just to reject in most cases tho). Then starts the rat race amongst the freshers where everyone is trying to get into as many of these (or at least one). These salesmen (seniors) talk as if your life ends if you are not part of any club/society (which is not the case and they also know that).

At this point, with a lot of information overloaded, we freshers start chasing the applications just because we don't want to miss out (fomo), without thinking whether we are actually interested in being part of that society or club. There are few (like me, the curious, ðŸ˜…) who think before applying and apply only to clubs or positions which genuinely excites them. After a bit of chaos and happiness for a few and disappointment for a few others, most of these people end up in some club/society and a few in multiple clubs or societies not thinking about whether they have the time to manage everything (typically we don't consider the academics, as the saying comes from seniors "classes lite").

The following are the positions I applied for (might look overwhelming):

| Year  | Position              | Club/Society                 | Outcome      | Reason                                                                    |

It was overwhelming (and suffocating at the same time) when I look back at what all I did. I would say I enjoyed being part of the [Mathematics Club](https://mathiitm.com) the most, partially because of the kind of work I did but mostly because of the people I met and the connections I got and the impact it had on me. I also loved being a mentor where I got the chance to interact with fresh (and mostly eager and innocent) brains coming in so that I felt a bit nostalgic and younger with them, a few became good friends of mine. I also loved being the Department Legislator and Eventually Secretary of CSA where I got the oppurtunity to meet people from very diverse background and years and perspectives. During those days I used to feel a lot of work pressure that I need to give my 100% to whatever I took upon, which sometimes (prolly most) left me with no time for myself other activities. This made me feel exhausted at times. Nevertheless these PoRs gave me exposure and opportunity to meet a lot of new people and explore a few new things and gave me the experience of leading and working in a team. These had a impact on the kind of person I am today.

Now, if I look back and think about those I feel I appreciated the experience of meeting new people and creating new connections rather than the work in most of the cases. But this thought comes only in retrospect and not during the tenure. Trust me, whenever I took some PoR I was pretty sure that I was interested in doing that and had some expectations. But most of them failed to deliver what I expected, it might be because of many other factors. The only exception is CSA Secretary (partially because I did most of the things the way I envisioned).

I feel that there are a lot of things that you might feel that you like but not everything might deliver what you expect. Along with that there is a bandwidth for you to accomodate these things along with the other aspects of the college life and one should not overlook that line and chase the PoRs. I think it is good to be part of PoRs not just because you get to learn a lot of (mostly technical) things or someone asked you to join some club or you can add this as a resume point. In my opinion there is much more that a team can offer you in terms of people you get to meet (prolly you can find your girlfriend or boyfriend as well ðŸ˜œ). So instead of just blindly trying to join a lot of (or as many as you can) PoRs that completely exhaust you, choose a subset of your interests and formally commit to them and meet people with similar interests and explore your other interests in the remaining time (at the same time keep in mind that "classes are not lite"). But remember, Never leave the inner fire or enthusiasm with which you started at any point of time and most importantly your true self in this rat race/exploration race (whatever you want to call it).
