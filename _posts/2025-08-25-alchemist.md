# Review

The book talks about a young sheperd who goes in search of a treasure which keeps coming in his dreams. The plot is very well written highlights his journey. The most important thing that kept me hooked to the book is that the dilemma he has at many points of life whether to settle with whatever he has gained till now or he should trust his dream (cues from nature) and pursue that despite being a comfortable choice already present. 

After reading the book, I kept asking the following things to myself:
- What do I want to do with my life?
- What is the one thing I want in my life? Is it money? luxury? job? research?
- What keeps me happy?
- Am I living in a comfort zone doing not what my heart wants?

The book made me ask deeper questions to myself which I have never asked before. It kind of gave me the maturity to ask questions which usually I don't want to ask myself, not because I don't know the answer but to pursue the answer I should come out of my comfort zone. I feel the book is a suggested read to ask more and deeper questions to yourself and understand what your true inner self wants. The book taught me to `listen to my heart`.
